### CONFIG FILE FOR BARCODE_BINNER
#####################################################
##this file contains key configuration information
##a config file is used for consistency given the program
##may be restarted multiple times with multiple users
##thus an expert user is allowed to fully control how it setsup
## and other users can simply execute the program
 
##unlike other config files variable names are case sensitive
#white space is a delimiter  and thus adhored within a key or a value
#NOTE -- white space will be removed between keys and values
###############################################################
#NOTE -- leading white space on a line associates the data on 
#         next line with previous line (don't do it)

[BINS]
#bins/bags are where samples will be placed 
#BADBARCODE is where barcodes go that don't match a sample barcode
#FAILEDBIN is the bin/bag where all bins go if they don't mactch provide
#regex: is used for regular expression denotation

[REQUIRED]

FILEOUTSAMPLE=outputfile_samples_processed.tsv
#   is where data from input is saved once scanned

FILEOUTBAD=outputfile_badcodes.tsv
#   all BADCODE designations 
#   essentially everything that can't match as sample
#   barcodes that don't match pattern or don't map to sample

 
BAGSIZE=50
#  default size (# of samples) of bag -- overide in [BAGSIZE]

#name of the bag set if potentially combinding numerous sets
BAGSETNAME=GhanaJAB
#name for set of bags -- may be useful if multiple scans taking place

 
BAGNUM=1
#    is the starting bag number which increments as bags fill
#regular expression to match within the barcode in the samplesheet AND the scanned barcode
# it will extract the first grouping "()" 
# for example (P\d+) this allows P_32342-1 to match P32342-4 

BARCODEMATCH=(P\d+)
#regular expression applied to scanned barcode and the sample file barcodes
#allows common code to be matched 

[BAGSIZE]
#nondefault bagsize for bins above as well as BADBIN and BADCODE

[BAGNUM]
#nodefault bag# to start at from bins above as well as BADBIN and BADCODE
